# This set up works for C, Python and Javascript at the moment

## Instructions on how to get this up and running

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `setup_ubuntu.sh`
3. Run Install.py with the right arguments in YouCompleteMe for
   autocompletion(Should this be its own script?)
4. Install Powerline Fonts for vim [here](https://github.com/powerline/fonts)
   (TODO make this into its own script)
5. Use adobe source pro font medium so that there's abit more margin between
   lines. Gnome terminal doesn't give the ability to edit this manually unlike
   terminal in mac

### Make bash look good with base16-shell
__This is a todo__
1. Download base-16 shell scripts
2. Follow instructions on the documentation to install and ensure that terminal supports 256 colors
3. Use base16_default-dark for a theme thats easy on the eyes

### Things to Note
1. Use the adobe source pro font instsalled from the fonts for vim-powerline/airline. Gives abit of margin between lines.
   This helps with using Vim on Ubuntu since gnome terminal doe'snt give the ability to do this manually

### Make Unity look good
1. Use flat theme
2. Plank for dock
3. And make boxes transparent
